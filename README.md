# 🐍 Python builtins
This library is re-write of python existing builtins in python,
I wrote this library to improve my programming skills,
it isn't meant to be used as a replacement for the current
python builtins nor this is an attempt to reinvent the wheel.
This library can be better utilized for studying python builtins.

> Python version `3.11`

### SOURCE BEHIND THE CODE

It was solely written based on the python builtins
execution output and in an attempt to closely resemble them.

* Note: it might not result the same result in some cases.
* Note: this library only contains few python builtins.

### THIS IS MY FIRST LIBRARY on GitHub
* Release Date: 22-Feb-2022 ; Tuesday

I'm currently in 1st semester at my university at the time of releasing this library.


### Reason behind writing this library
As an Intermediate, I was curious to know the functioning of these built-in ones since
I couldn't find anything useful and understandable on the web what I was looking for
specifically, so I re-wrote this library to better understand them and discovered
their various use cases and also the reason behind their unexpected output.

### My experience while writing this library
It wasn't easy as anticipated things didn't go as planned
some days felt like there was no progress which paid off the next day.
It exceeded my estimated time limit due to reforms, fixes, and improvements
that had to be made during the process whenever encountered with new bugs or
learned new concepts and also added the fact I wanted to make this library
as perfect as much possible so any imperfections couldn't be left unattended.

### CONCLUSION
Overall this was worth the time and effort. by doing all of that
I could learn these concepts thoroughly and deeply which I wasn't aware
of or didn't care about which improved and polished my programming skills.
