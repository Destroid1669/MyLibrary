# 🐍 Python Functions and Methods
This library is re-write of python existing functions and methods
I wrote this library to improve my programming skills, this library
isn't meant to be used as a replacement of current python built-in
ones nor this is an attempt to reinvent the wheel.

>> python version 3.10
## PURPOSE OF THIS LIBRARY
This library is meant to be studied to get better
understanding of the Python built-in functions and methods.

## SOURCE BEHIND THE CODE

It was solely written based on the python built-in ones
execution output and in an attempt to closely resemble them.

* Note: it might not result same result in some rare cases.
* Note: this library doesn't contain all python_built ones.

## THIS IS MY FIRST LIBRARY on github
* Release Date: 22-feb-2022; tuesday

I'm currently in the first semester in my </br>
university at this time of releasing this library. </br>


## Reason behind writing this library
initially as intermediate, I didn't care much about remembering and utilizing
these built-it ones were provided to use in the program when I could simply write
my own functions to do the same operation, during writing this library I realized
the importance and benefits these libraries came up with when I compared their execution
time and well-written code efficiency to mine. and also the reason behind their weirdness.

## My Experience while writing this library
it was a bit difficult as I anticipated things didn't go as planned somedays felt like
there was no progress which paid of next day, I anticipated this to take max one month
but it took me more than that I had to make re-corrections fixes, improvements to code
whenever I found some code-breaking bugs or learned some new concepts i intended to make
this library as much perfect as possible so couldn't let any imperfection left unattended
resulting in exceeding my expected time limit, I did this all by myself without anyone's
external help that sometimes made me feel lost and confused in what I was doing.


## CONCLUSION
Overall This was worth the time and effort because it improved and polished </br>
my skills as I intended, it was challenging and fun and it taught me concepts </br>
I was not aware of or didn't care about which taught me those concepts very deeply.

## Everyone is welcome to make contributions to this repository
I initially solely wrote this library to improve my programming skills </br>
anyone interested to make use of it or make contributions are warmly welcomed.
