# 🐍 Python Functions and Methods
This library is re-write of python existing functions and methods
I wrote this library to improve my programming skills, this library
isn't meant to be used as a replacement of current python built-in
ones nor this is an attempt to reinvent the wheel.

> Python version `3.10`
## PURPOSE OF THIS LIBRARY
This library is meant to be studied to get better
understanding of the Python built-in functions and methods.

## SOURCE BEHIND THE CODE

It was solely written based on the python built-in ones
execution output and in an attempt to closely resemble them.

* Note: it might not result same result in some rare cases.
* Note: this library doesn't contain all python built-in ones.

## THIS IS MY FIRST LIBRARY on GitHub
* Release Date: 22-Feb-2022; Tuesday

I'm currently in 1st semester at my university at the time of releasing this library. </br>


## Reason behind writing this library
Initially as intermediate, I didn't care much about remembering and utilizing these built-it ones were provided to use in the program </br>
when I could simply write my own functions to do the same operation. While writing this library, I realized the importance and benefits </br>
of these libraries when I compared their execution time and well-written code efficiency to mine, and also the reason behind their weirdness.

## My experience while writing this library
It was a bit difficult as I anticipated things didn't go as planned somedays felt like
there was no progress which paid of next day, I anticipated this to take max one month
but it took me more than that. I had to make re-corrections fixes, improvements to code
whenever I found some code-breaking bugs or learned some new concepts I intended to make
this library as much perfect as possible so I couldn't let any imperfection left unattended
resulting in exceeding my expected time limit, I did this all by myself without anyone's
external help that sometimes made me feel lost and confused in what I was doing.


## CONCLUSION
Overall this was worth the time and effort because it improved and polished my skills as I intended, it was challenging and fun and it taught me concepts I was not aware of or didn't care about because of that I could learn these concepts very deeply.

## Everyone is welcomed to make contributions to this repository
I initially solely wrote this library to improve my programming skills. </br>
It is warmly welcomed to use this project. Contributors are welcome to improve the project.
